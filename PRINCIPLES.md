# First Principles of the GROVE Framework

This document defines the foundational principles that underpin the GROVE Framework. These principles are not generic—they are deliberate, opinionated, and designed to correct specific limitations in legacy security models.

## Why State These Principles?

Most existing frameworks (e.g. ISO 27001, NIST CSF, COBIT) are built around **compliance, control catalogs, and static risk scoring**. While useful in regulated environments, they often:
- Treat security as a checklist, not a system property
- Assume risk can be quantified in isolation from context
- Focus on pre-event controls, ignoring post-event dynamics
- Emphasize protection over survivability
- Separate decision-making from security operations

The GROVE principles are designed to **recenter security as a dynamic, decision-oriented, system-level concern**. They provide a foundation for reasoning under uncertainty, adapting to disruption, and aligning security with strategic leadership.

## 1. Security is a System Property

Security is not a feature or a control—it is an emergent property of the entire system. It arises from the interaction of people, processes, technologies, and environments over time.

## 2. Risk is Contextual and Dynamic

Risk is not a static score or label. It is a dynamic relationship between threat, vulnerability, exposure, and consequence—shaped by context, intent, and time.

## 3. Survivability Over Perfection

No system is perfectly secure. The goal is not to eliminate all risk, but to ensure the system can survive, adapt, and recover from disruption.

## 4. Control is Temporal and Layered

Controls are not binary. They operate before, during, and after events—each with different logic, actors, and effectiveness. Control must be mapped across time and layers.

## 5. Decision-Making is the Core Security Function

Security is not just about protection—it is about enabling informed, timely, and accountable decisions under uncertainty.
