# Scenario Matrix for Executive Decision-Making

The GROVE Framework defines seven canonical security scenarios. These are not arbitrary—they are derived from a complete and exhaustive analysis of all possible system states based on the presence or absence of three elements:
- **Threat**: Present or absent
- **Vulnerability**: Present or absent
- **Asset**: Present or absent

This binary logic yields \(2^3 = 8\) combinations. One is a null state (no threat, no vulnerability, no asset), leaving **seven meaningful scenarios**. These form the basis for posture shifts, control alignment, and executive decision-making.

## Why Exactly Seven Scenarios?

The model is:
- **Exhaustive**: Covers all operationally relevant combinations
- **Minimal**: No redundant or overlapping categories
- **Actionable**: Each scenario maps to distinct control logic and decision posture

## Scenario Overview

| Scenario     | Description                     | Primary Concern   | Decision Focus        |
|--------------|----------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| 1. Normal     | Business-as-usual operations     | Latent risk        | Maintain posture       |
| 2. Alert      | Elevated threat or anomaly       | Early detection    | Escalate or contain    |
| 3. Incident   | Confirmed security event         | Impact containment | Activate response      |
| 4. Crisis     | Systemic or cascading failure    | Survival           | Command and control    |
| 5. Recovery   | Post-incident restoration        | Resilience         | Rebuild and learn      |
| 6. Reform     | Strategic redesign               | Structural risk    | Transform systems      |
| 7. Degrade    | Controlled shutdown or retreat   | Existential risk   | Exit or isolate        |

## Scenario Attributes

Each scenario is mapped to:
- **Control Objectives**: What must be achieved
- **Decision Rights**: Who decides, and how
- **Information Needs**: What data is required
- **Time Sensitivity**: How fast decisions must be made

This matrix supports real-time decision-making under pressure, enabling leaders to act with clarity, speed, and accountability.
