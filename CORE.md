# 🧠 GROVE Framework — Governed Risk-Oriented Visibility for Executives

## 🎯 Strategic Context

Most security frameworks are built for compliance, not consequence. They catalogue controls, assign scores, and assume that risk can be managed through static checklists. But in real-world environments—where threats evolve, systems fail, and decisions must be made under pressure—this approach breaks down.

The GROVE Framework is designed for those environments. It is a logic framework for **thinking**, **deciding**, and **adapting** under uncertainty. It is built for executives, architects, and operators who must align strategy, operations, and resilience in the face of real threats.

## 1. Foundational Concept: What Is a Security Risk?

GROVE defines security risk as the **co-presence** of three elements:  
**Security Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Asset**  
If any one is absent, there is no meaningful risk. This is not a metaphor—it is a logical model that underpins the entire framework.

### Key Definitions
- **Asset**: Anything of value—people, systems, data, infrastructure.  
  No asset, no risk.
- **Threat**: A vector of harm, delivered by a threat actor with intent and capability.  
  Threats are not generic—they are specific, contextual, and dynamic.
- **Vulnerability**: A condition of exposure due to inadequate or failed controls.  
  Vulnerability is not a flaw—it is a **state** that emerges when controls are absent, weak, or misaligned.

## 2. Seven-Scenario Matrix: Exhaustive Risk States

By applying binary logic (present/absent) to each of the three elements (Threat, Vulnerability, Asset), we derive **eight combinations**. One is null (no asset, no threat, no vulnerability), leaving **seven operationally relevant scenarios**.

| Scenario | Threat | Vulnerability | Asset | Risk Level | Example                                | Strategic Action             |
|----------|--------|---------------|-------|------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| 1        | ✅     | ✅            | ✅    | High       | Unlocked office with sensitive documents | Deploy controls immediately  |
| 2        | ❌     | ✅            | ✅    | Medium     | Unsecured area with no known threat     | Investigate & prepare        |
| 3        | ✅     | ❌            | ✅    | Low        | Locked server room with known threat actor | Maintain vigilance        |
| 4        | ❌     | ❌            | ✅    | Minimal    | Secured asset with no threat            | Monitor for changes          |
| 5        | ✅     | ✅            | ❌    | No Risk    | Threat actor targeting non-existent asset | Maintain threat awareness |
| 6        | ❌     | ❌            | ❌    | No Risk    | Controls in place but no asset or threat | Reassess control necessity |
| 7        | ❌     | ✅            | ❌    | No Risk    | Controls protecting non-existent asset  | Reallocate resources         |

This matrix is **exhaustive**. There are no other combinations. It provides a shared mental model for executives and operators to assess posture, allocate resources, and shift strategy.

## 3. Survivability Model: Layered, Recursive Defense

GROVE assumes that controls will fail. The goal is not perfect protection—it is **survivability**: the ability to endure, adapt, and recover.

The survivability model is structured as a **layered onion**, where each layer assumes the failure of the one before it:

### Layer 1: Predict
- Anticipate threats before they materialize.
- Actions: Threat actor profiling, counterintelligence, horizon scanning.

### Layer 2: Prevent
- Block threats from forming or accessing targets.
- Actions: Access controls, segmentation, personnel vetting.

### Layer 3: Control and Assure
- Stop threat actions even if access is gained.
- Actions: Encryption, authentication, process integrity.

### Layer 4: Disrupt
- Respond at the moment of eventuation to reduce impact.
- Actions: Incident response, tactical containment, threat neutralisation.

A threat must penetrate all four layers to cause harm. This model is **recursive**—lessons from Disrupt feed back into Predict.

## 4. Bowtie Logic: Temporal Control Mapping

The bowtie model maps controls across time:  
[Threat] → [Preventive Controls] → [Event] → [Responsive Controls] → [Outcome]

- **Left side**: Preventive controls (owned by engineering, policy)  
- **Right side**: Responsive controls (owned by ops, crisis teams)  
- **Event node**: The moment of control failure

This model enables:
- Temporal governance: Who owns what, when
- Scenario alignment: Mapping controls to the 7-state matrix
- Gap analysis: Where controls fail or are missing

## 5. How GROVE Differs from Legacy Frameworks

| Legacy Models (e.g. NIST, ISO) | GROVE |
|--------------------------------|-------|
| Control catalogues             | Logical reasoning model |
| Static risk scores             | Dynamic scenario matrix |
| Prevention-focused             | Survivability-focused |
| Compliance-driven              | Decision-driven |
| Terminology-heavy              | Definition-grounded |

GROVE is not a replacement for compliance frameworks—it is a **thinking layer** that makes them operationally useful.

## 6. Strategic Integration

GROVE enables:
- Executive prioritisation of security investments
- Scenario-based decision-making across threat landscapes
- Maturity-based vulnerability assessment using control layering
- Intelligence-led planning to stay ahead of adversaries
- Event-oriented control mapping for operational resilience
