# 🧠 GROVE Framework — Strategic Positioning

## 🔍 Why GROVE?

Most security frameworks were built for compliance—not consequence. They rely on static scoring, ignore control layering, and fail to model threat actor behavior. GROVE was built to change that.

GROVE is a decision-first security framework designed for post-AI, cloud-native, and cyber-resilient environments. It enables strategic clarity under pressure by integrating layered observability, threat logic, and control mapping.

## 🧬 What Makes GROVE Different?

- **Asset-first logic** — no asset, no risk.
- **Control adequacy as vulnerability** — maturity-based, not binary.
- **Threat actor ≠ threat** — one actor, many threats.
- **Survivability layering** — Predict → Prevent → Control → Disrupt.
- **Bowtie logic** — maps control timing across the event lifecycle.
- **Seven-scenario matrix** — all combinations, no blind spots.
- **Disruption layer** — supports real-time response and containment.
- **First principles foundation** — security as a system property, not a checklist.

## 🧱 Foundational Logic

GROVE isn’t just a toolkit—it’s built on first principles. It treats security as a system property, not a checklist. Risk is modeled as the co-presence of threat, vulnerability, and asset—yielding a seven-scenario matrix that covers all operational states.

Its survivability model assumes controls will fail, layering Predict → Prevent → Control → Disrupt to ensure resilience. Bowtie logic maps these layers across time, enabling event-oriented planning and governance.

This structure makes GROVE both philosophically grounded and operationally deployable.

## 🔷 Why GROVE Is Needed

Most security frameworks:

- Focus on technical controls (e.g. firewalls, IAM).  
- Use likelihood × impact scoring, which is often subjective.  
- Treat vulnerability as a static checkbox.  
- Don’t model threat actor behavior or control layering.  
- Lack scenario completeness and decision traceability.

| Capability                             | Value                                                                 |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Asset-first logic**                  | Prevents false positives—no asset, no risk.                           |
| **Threat actor vs threat distinction** | Models multi-vector attacks and actor behavior.                       |
| **Control adequacy as vulnerability**  | Enables maturity-based risk scoring.                                  |
| **Survivability layering**             | Aligns with defense-in-depth and zero-trust principles.               |
| **Bowtie logic**                       | Tracks threat pathways across pre/post-event controls.                |
| **Scenario matrix**                    | Covers all combinations—no blind spots.                               |
| **Disruption layer**                   | Supports real-time response and containment.                          |
