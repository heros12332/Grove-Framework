# GROVE Framework — Strategic Positioning (Interop-First)

## Why GROVE (in one screen)
Most frameworks already link threats, vulnerabilities, and risk—but they live in separate artifacts (risk registers, vuln scans, ATT&CK matrices, control catalogs). GROVE does **not** replace them. It’s an **interop-first decision layer** that composes what you already use into **one pathway-centric view** you can brief to executives.

**One-liner:** Distinguish the parts, integrate the view—then decide.  
**Tagline:** Interop-first security decisions.

---

## What Makes GROVE Different
- **Asset-first logic** — No asset, no risk. Scope is concrete and crown-jewel led.
- **Control adequacy as vulnerability** — Maturity and coverage (0–3), not binary presence.
- **Threat actor ≠ threat** — Separate *who* from *how* to model blended campaigns.
- **Survivability layering** — Predict → Prevent → Control → Disrupt (assume failures).
- **Bowtie backbone** — Map pre/post-event controls to specific pathways over time.
- **Seven-state scenario matrix** — Force coverage; expose blind spots.
- **Disruption layer** — Make live containment/automation a first-class decision object.
- **Interop-first by design** — Composes NIST/ISO/FAIR/ATT&CK into one decision surface.

## The Single Decision Surface (how GROVE integrates without blurring)
1) **Asset** (crown-jewel business service / data / platform)  
2) **Actor + Threat pathway** (specific, ATT&CK-mapped)  
3) **Control adequacy (0–3)** on *pathway-cutting* controls  
4) **Survivability layers**: Predict → Prevent → Control → Disrupt  
5) **Scenario state (1–7)** to reveal gaps and target state  
6) **Decision**: the one change that most collapses the pathway or accelerates disruption

> Output: a 1-page, board-ready brief with traceability from asset to control delta.

### The Seven Scenario States (starter definition)
1) No credible actor pressure  
2) Actor present, no viable pathway (architecture/controls already close it)  
3) Pathway viable, controls absent  
4) Pathway viable, controls partial (incomplete coverage)  
5) Pathway viable, prevention proven; detect/respond weak  
6) Pathway viable; disruption manual (slow/inconsistent)  
7) Layered controls proven **and** disruption automated (target state)

## Interop in Practice (keep your stack; make it decisive)
- Populate pathway steps with **MITRE ATT&CK** techniques.  
- Map controls and outcomes to **NIST CSF / ISO 27001** for governance and audits.  
- Feed **adequacy deltas** and **scenario definitions** into **FAIR** when quantifying.  
- Record the decision and owner in the **risk register**—with a real control change.

### Tiny Compare Table (complement, not competition)
| You have…              | Keep using it for…                  | GROVE adds…                                           |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| NIST CSF / ISO 27001   | organizing controls & governance    | adequacy deltas + layering to pick the next move      |
| MITRE ATT&CK           | pathways/tactics vocabulary         | pathway→control mapping + bowtie timing               |
| FAIR                   | quantified loss modeling            | scoped scenarios + adequacy inputs for FAIR           |
| Risk register          | catalog of concerns                 | one integrated view to drive executive decisions      |

## Strategic Impact (why leaders care)
- **Faster decisions** — compress debate into pathway-specific control changes.  
- **Traceability** — every recommendation is explainable from asset → pathway → adequacy.  
- **Fewer single points of failure** — survivability layering exposes weak links.  
- **Cloud-/AI-era fit** — explicit actor modeling and automation-aware disruption.

---

## Where to Use GROVE First (the wedge)
- Posture-shift memos (new platforms, M&A, “Are we exposed to X?”)  
- Incident containment choices (“What one change reduces risk this quarter?”)  
- Board/audit alignment (one page from asset → pathway → adequacy → decision)

**Expansion:** From one crown-jewel to a scenario matrix across business units.

---

## How to Measure Value (starter KPIs)
- **Time-to-decision:** question → approved change (target ≤ 14 days)  
- **Scenario coverage:** % of priority assets with a worked bowtie and adequacy scoring  
- **Adequacy deltas:** count of 0→1 and 1→2 upgrades on pathway-cutting controls per quarter  
- **Survivability minutes at risk:** expected exposure before effective containment

---

## One-Asset Quickstart (30–90 minutes)
1) Pick one crown-jewel asset.  
2) Name the actor + threat pathway of concern.  
3) Sketch the bowtie (pre/post-event controls).  
4) Score control adequacy (0–3) on pathway-cutting controls.  
5) Place the situation in the seven-state matrix.  
6) Propose **one** change that collapses the pathway or automates disruption.  
7) Capture a 1-page decision brief.

## Who Should Use GROVE
- CISOs & Risk Officers — resource prioritisation and strategic clarity  
- Security Architects — layered control design tied to pathways  
- Governance Committees — traceable, scenario-based decisions  
- Public Sector Planners — resilience with compliance alignment  
- Enterprise IT Teams — integration with M365/Copilot and cloud-native platforms
