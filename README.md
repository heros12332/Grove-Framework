# 🧠 GROVE Framework — Governed Risk-Oriented Visibility for Executives

## 🔍 What Is GROVE?

GROVE is a decision-first security framework built for executive clarity in dynamic environments. It integrates layered observability, threat logic, and control mapping to support posture shifts, incident response, and governance alignment. It replaces static scoring with scenario-based reasoning and survivability modeling—enabling strategic decisions under pressure.

## 🎯 Why GROVE?

Most security frameworks:
- Focus on technical controls (e.g. firewalls, IAM)
- Use likelihood × impact scoring, which is often subjective
- Treat vulnerability as a static checkbox
- Don’t model threat actor behavior or control layering
- Lack scenario completeness and decision traceability

GROVE fills these gaps by offering:

| Capability                          | Value                                                  |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Asset-first logic**              | Prevents false positives—no asset, no risk             |
| **Threat actor vs threat distinction** | Models multi-vector attacks and actor behavior     |
| **Control adequacy as vulnerability** | Enables maturity-based risk scoring                |
| **Survivability layering**         | Aligns with defense-in-depth and zero-trust principles |
| **Bowtie logic**                   | Tracks threat pathways across pre/post-event controls  |
| **Scenario matrix**                | Covers all combinations—no blind spots                |
| **Disruption layer**               | Supports real-time response and containment            |

## 👥 Who Is It For?

- **CISOs and Risk Officers** – for resource prioritisation and strategic clarity
- **Security Architects** – for control design and layered defense
- **Governance Committees** – for traceable, scenario-based decisions
- **Public Sector Planners** – for resilience and compliance alignment
- **Enterprise IT Teams** – for integration into MS365 and Copilot environments

## 🧩 Core Components

| File                  | Description                              |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `core.md`            | Full framework write-up                  |
| `scenario-matrix.md`        | Seven-scenario matrix with examples      |
| `layered-controls.md`    | Layered defense model                    |
| `risk-process.md`           | Event-oriented control mapping           |

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Read `core.md`** to understand the foundational logic
2. **Use `scenario-matrix.md`** to map your current risk posture
3. **Apply `control-onion.md`** to assess control adequacy
4. **Use `risk-bowtie.md`** to trace threat pathways and control interactions
